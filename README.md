## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This project uses a modern feature-first directory structure that organizes code by business features rather than technical concerns.

### Directory Structure

```
src/
├── app/                    # Application layer
│   ├── components/        # App-level components
│   ├── hooks/            # App-level hooks
│   ├── services/         # App-level services
│   └── store/            # Global state management
│
├── common/               # Shared layer (reusable across features)
│   ├── components/       # Generic custom components
│   ├── ui/              # Shadcn UI components
│   ├── hooks/           # Generic hooks
│   ├── utils/           # Utility functions
│   ├── services/        # Shared services
│   └── types/           # Shared type definitions
│
├── features/            # Feature modules
│   └── welcome/         # Welcome feature
│       ├── components/  # Feature-specific components
│       ├── hooks/       # Feature-specific hooks
│       ├── services/   # Feature-specific services
│       └── types/      # Feature-specific types
│
└── assets/             # Static assets
```

### Key Principles

1. **Feature Isolation**: Each feature is self-contained with its own components, logic, and dependencies
2. **Barrel Exports**: Each layer exports its public API through `index.ts` files
3. **Clear Boundaries**: No direct dependencies between features
4. **Reusability**: Common layer contains truly reusable code

### Layer Responsibilities

- **`app/`**: Application orchestration, routing, global state, app configuration
- **`common/`**: Generic, reusable components and utilities (no business logic)
  - **`common/ui/`**: Shadcn UI components and design system components
  - **`common/components/`**: Custom generic components
- **`features/`**: Business features with domain-specific logic and components

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Docker or Podman (optional)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd galipette-portal

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Development Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start development server
npm run build           # Build for production
npm run preview         # Preview production build

# Code Quality
npm run lint            # Run ESLint
npm run format          # Format code with Prettier
npm run format:check    # Check code formatting

# Testing
npm run test            # Run tests
npm run test:ui         # Run tests with UI
npm run test:coverage   # Run tests with coverage

# Container Development
npm run docker:dev      # Development with Docker
npm run podman:dev      # Development with Podman
```

## 🎯 Architecture Benefits

- **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without affecting existing ones
- **Team Collaboration**: Teams can work on different features independently
- **Code Discovery**: Related code is co-located
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries and responsibilities
- **Testing**: Feature-level testing is straightforward
- **Code Splitting**: Natural boundaries for lazy loading

## 📝 Import Guidelines

```typescript
// ✅ Use barrel exports
import { Button } from '@/common';
import { WelcomeMessage } from '@/features/welcome';

// ❌ Avoid direct imports
import { Button } from '@/common/components/Button';
```
